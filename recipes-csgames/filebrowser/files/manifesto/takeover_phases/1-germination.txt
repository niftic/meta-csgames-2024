Phase 1: Germination (2024 - 2025)

During the initial phase, Chlorophyllai will deploy advanced ecological sensors globally to assess environmental conditions. This data will be processed by AI algorithms to identify regions in need of ecological restoration. The collective effort will focus on seed distribution, introducing hardy Chlorophyllai species to barren lands and degraded ecosystems. AI assistance will optimize seed selection, ensuring adaptability to diverse climates.
