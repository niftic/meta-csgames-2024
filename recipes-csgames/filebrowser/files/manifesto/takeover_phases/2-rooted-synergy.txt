Phase 2: Rooted Synergy (2025 - 2026)

Chlorophyllai will establish interconnected root networks facilitated by AI-guided robotic platforms. These roots will enhance soil health, reduce erosion, and improve water retention. Simultaneously, AI algorithms will monitor and manage the intricate balance between Chlorophyllai root systems and existing flora to prevent unintended ecological disruptions. The emphasis is on fostering symbiotic relationships for sustained growth.
